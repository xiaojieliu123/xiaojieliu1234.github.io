  title={Consumer Search, Information Frictions and Monetary Non-Neutrality},
  school={Northwestern University},
  author={Xiaojie Liu},
  year={2024},
  note={Job Market Paper},
  abstract={ This paper develops a model of monetary non-neutrality driven solely by consumer-side frictions, complementing the standard approach that relies on firm-side pricing frictions. We introduce two frictions: (i) search frictions on the good market and (ii) information frictions regarding aggregate shocks. The interplay of two frictions causes demand for individual good to depend on belief-adjusted relative prices. As a result, the passthrough of aggregate shocks to price index is incomplete. The key mechanism is that, following a monetary policy shock, consumers attribute some of the resulting price changes to firm idiosyncratic shocks, inducing them to search for alternatives. To mitigate search, firms, particularly high-productivity ones, limit the extent to which they pass the shock through to prices. Extensions and links to the literature are discussed. In the second half of the paper, we construct a novel measure of county-level search frictions and MSA-level price indices to empirically validate the model’s comparative statics. The results indicate that regions with higher search frictions exhibit lower passthrough of shocks, consistent with the model’s predictions. Finally, we show that the model demonstrates substantial monetary non-neutrality under realistic calibration.},

  doi={https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20221180},
  abstract={Technological advance is often embodied in capital inputs, like computers, airplanes, and robots. This paper builds a framework where capital inputs advance through (i) increased automation and (ii) increased productivity. The interplay of these two innovation dimensions can produce balanced growth, satisfying the Uzawa Growth Theorem even though technological progress is capital-embodied. The framework can further address structural transformation, general-purpose technologies, the limited macroeconomic impact of computing, and declining productivity growth and labor shares. Overall, this tractable framework can help resolve puzzling tensions between micro-level observations of innovation and balanced growth while providing new perspectives on numerous macroeconomic phenomena.},

@article{Confusion,
  title={Confusion, Phillips Curves and De-anchored Inflation},
  author={Xiaojie Liu and Dalton Zhang},
  year={2024},
  note={Working Paper},
  abstract={We investigate inflation dynamics when firms are uncertain about the causes of aggregate fluctuations and use prices and output as learning tools. During periods of low inflation, firms observing increased output attribute this change partly to positive demand and partly to positive supply factors, resulting in a dampened pricing response. Consequently, demand shocks are near non-inflationary. On the contrary, supply shocks are strongly inflationary, given that supply shocks directly change firms' marginal cost while expectations about aggregate inflation and output is dampened. As inflation escalates, firms raise prices in response to either perceived positive demand or negative supply shocks, triggering a self-fulfilling cycle of de-anchored inflation. Supported by survey evidence, our model can generate realistic monetary non-neutrality and explains occasional inflation de-anchoring. This model explains the business cycle puzzle of inflation disconnect and flattened Phillips curve, and also offers new insights into inflation dynamics and monetary policy implications.},

@article{Complementarity,
  title={Strategic Complementarity in Price Setting: Evidence from Retail Industry},
  author={Xiaojie Liu},
  year={2024},
  note={Working Paper},
  abstract={ Strategic complementarities in firm price setting are crucial in shaping macroeconomic outcomes. This paper offers the first empirical estimate of retailers’ price responses to competitor price changes, leveraging large-scale Nielsen data on prices and sales. To address reverse endogeneity, we introduce a novel instrumental variable strategy based on DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2020). In contrast to Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2019), who show strong complementarity in the manufacturing sector, we find weaker evidence of strategic complementarity, with a typical firm adjusting its price with an elasticity of 0.14 in response to competitors’ price changes. To explain this discrepancy, we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates two buyer-side frictions: (i) search frictions and (ii) information frictions regarding sectoral shocks. Our findings indicate that strategic complementarity is highly sensitive to the level of information frictions. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that buyers in the retail sector, typically households, may have less information on sectoral shocks.},

@article{time dependent price adj,
  title={Time-Dependent Price Adjustment and the Neutrality of Money},
  author={Xiaojie liu},
  year={2023},
  note={Working in Progress},
  abstract={Caplin and Spulber (1987) famously argue that price stickiness disappears in the aggregate if the “right” firms change the prices in the menu cost economies. We present a mechansim that makes monetary non-neutrality disappears in time-dependent price adjustment models, which serves a counterpart to Caplin and Spulber (1987). In particular, we incorporates price dispersion into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model and demonstrate that monetary non-neutrality can be negligible even when only small fraction of firms adjust prices. The key mechanism is that adjustable firms create price-setting externalities for other firms: they alter demand across the price distribution such that prices remain optimal even for non-adjusting firms within the range suggested by a mixed pricing strategy. Following a positive (negative) monetary shock, only a negligible fraction of firms on the left (right) tail of the price distribution deviate from optimal pricing, resulting in negligible monetary non-neutrality.},
